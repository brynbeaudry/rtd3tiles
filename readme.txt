uses time scale

haven't read the date breakdown, Y W? Does that mean Year week?
I don't really know what that means.
It's possible that, when the values come in from the original JSON data, that they are supposed to be added to eachother? Like if there are two volume data for Sept 10, which there is, then should those volume datas be added together, and then the corresponding NPS values for those data elements be averaged?
average the score

What exactly is the maximum character length for the label? Are you talking about maximum characters of the tooltip label of maximum characters for the axis label?

If(YW)   then sort by time, and use a timescale.

Make sure if the value are for the same date that they are aggregated

Good, bar and line:
